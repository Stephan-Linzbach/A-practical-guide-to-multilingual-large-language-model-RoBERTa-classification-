# Text Classification Tutorial

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this tutorial, you will be able to:

- Define and implement a single-label classification task using a pre-trained language model.
- Fine-tune a pre-trained model on a specific classification dataset.
- Evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Interpret the results of a classification task.

## Description

This tutorial demonstrates the process of fine-tuning a pre-trained language model (e.g., RoBERTa) for a text classification task. It covers the steps from defining the task, setting up the model, and fine-tuning, to evaluating the model on test data. The focus is on applying advanced techniques like learning rate scheduling and selective optimization for effective training.
